linear models not always appropriate, for one test we use alpha =0.05 but 
there are so many tests needed. Bonferroni to accommodate all the 
p-values. False discovery rate, controlling the expected number of false 
positives. Negative binomial distribution, number of successes of 
repeating an event before you have a failure.
